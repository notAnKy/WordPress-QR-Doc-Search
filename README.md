# WordPress-QR-Doc-Search

A powerful WordPress plugin for QR code scanning and document search, allowing users to easily access PDF files by scanning QR codes or entering specific references.

## Features

### 1. QR Code Scanning with URL Input
- Users can enter a URL manually.
- Scanning a QR code adds extra information to the URL for seamless access.

### 2. QR Code Scanning to Open PDFs by Folder Name
- Users can access organized folder structures in the WordPress uploads directory.
- Each folder name serves as a reference, allowing a QR code scan to open the corresponding PDF file.
